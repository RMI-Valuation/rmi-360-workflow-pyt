# Proposed Changes for AI Processing Based on Image Intervals

## Objective

Enhance the consistency of image adjustments across sequences of panoramic images by processing them in intervals. The AI should take into account the image statistics for the current interval, as well as adjacent intervals, to ensure smooth transitions and avoid visible seams or abrupt changes in image enhancements.

## Proposed Workflow

The general workflow would consist of the following steps:

### Step 1: Collect Stats for Interval A
- **Action**: Collect statistics for all images within the first interval (`Interval A`).
- **Data Collected**: 
  - Brightness, contrast, and saturation statistics for each image in the interval.
  - Image metadata for each anchor frame in the interval.
  
### Step 2: AI Adjustment for Interval A
- **Action**: Pass the statistics for `Interval A` to ChatGPT (or an AI-based model) to determine enhancement parameters (e.g., contrast, gamma, CLAHE settings).
- **Expected Outcome**: ChatGPT provides a set of enhancement recommendations for the interval, including gamma, CLAHE settings, and any other adjustments.

### Step 3: Store Recommendation for Interval A
- **Action**: Store the enhancement recommendations for `Interval A`.
- **Data Stored**: 
  - Enhancement settings (gamma, CLAHE clip limit, etc.) for the interval.
  - Any additional notes or observations made by the AI.

### Step 4: Collect Stats for Interval B
- **Action**: Collect statistics for the next batch of images (`Interval B`).
- **Data Collected**: Same as `Interval A`, including brightness, contrast, saturation, and metadata for the images in `Interval B`.

### Step 5: AI Adjustment for Interval B
- **Action**: Pass the statistics for `Interval B` to ChatGPT (or an AI-based model) for enhancement recommendations.
- **Expected Outcome**: ChatGPT provides new enhancement settings for `Interval B`.

### Step 6: Store Recommendation for Interval B
- **Action**: Store the enhancement recommendations for `Interval B`.
- **Data Stored**: Similar to `Interval A` â€” gamma, CLAHE clip limits, etc.

### Step 7: Collect Stats for Additional Intervals (C, D, E, etc.)
- **Action**: Repeat the process for subsequent intervals (`Interval C`, `Interval D`, etc.) until all image batches are processed.
- **Data Collected**: As above, collect stats for each interval and store enhancement recommendations.

### Step 8: ChatGPT Review for Consistency Across Intervals
- **Action**: After gathering the enhancement recommendations for all intervals, pass the stored recommendations to ChatGPT for review.
- **Expected Outcome**: 
  - ChatGPT evaluates the recommendations across intervals to ensure consistency.
  - Adjustments are made to avoid sudden jumps or inconsistencies between the intervals (e.g., ensuring smooth transitions in contrast or brightness across intervals).
  
### Step 9: Adjust Recommendations for Smooth Transition
- **Action**: Based on the feedback from ChatGPT, adjust the enhancement parameters for each interval, ensuring that the transitions between intervals are gradual and consistent.
- **Expected Outcome**: 
  - Final recommendations for each interval that are consistent with each other.
  - The enhancements should be smooth and visually cohesive, with no visible seams.

### Step 10: Apply Final Adjustments
- **Action**: Apply the final recommendations for each interval to the images.
- **Expected Outcome**: 
  - Images are enhanced according to the revised, consistent settings.
  - The transition between consecutive images or intervals is seamless.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Consistency**: By evaluating multiple intervals and adjacent intervals, we ensure smooth transitions between image enhancements, avoiding visible seams or abrupt changes.
   
2. **Adaptive AI Processing**: ChatGPT (or the AI model) can make interval-specific adjustments based on the statistics for that batch of images, but it will also take adjacent intervals into account to ensure global consistency.
   
3. **Flexibility**: If AI assistance fails or is disabled, we can still fall back on a default, static enhancement plan for each interval without losing consistency.

4. **Optimization**: By using the AI to review the entire set of recommendations for multiple intervals, we optimize for a balanced result across the entire image sequence, rather than treating each image as an isolated enhancement case.

## Conclusion

This proposed AI-driven approach will maintain a consistent visual enhancement profile across large sets of panoramic images, ensuring smooth transitions between intervals while still allowing the AI to optimize adjustments. This workflow is more adaptive to changes in lighting or scene conditions while ensuring that the final enhanced images do not exhibit visible seams or inconsistent transitions.

By implementing this approach, we can create uniform adjustments across the entire set of images and significantly improve the visual consistency of the enhanced panoramic images.

**Next Steps**:
- Implement the new workflow logic in the existing image enhancement pipeline.
- Test the updated process on a sample set of panoramic images to verify smooth transitions and AI consistency.
- Monitor and fine-tune the ChatGPT feedback mechanism to ensure it can effectively handle real-world image sequences.
